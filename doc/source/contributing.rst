Contributing
============

NARCPACK is free and open-source software.
We welcome contributions from members of the community at all skill levels, from newcomers to seasoned veterans.
The main forum to reach is our GitHub issues_ page.
You should raise an issue if:

* you find a bug in our code
* there's a feature we don't have that would be useful to you
* the API for a particular function is unclear or unintuitive
* the documentation is unclear

and so forth.
If you would like to contribute code to NARCPACK, for bug fixes or new features, please do so by:

* forking the NARCPACK repository
* checking out a branch with a descriptive name in your fork
* committing your code in small, atomic patches to your fork
* writing any tests for new features that aren't already covered by our test suite
* submitting a pull request on GitHub

Pull requests need not be perfect!
If you want to contribute code but need our help, we're more than happy to work with you.
A pull request will draw it to your attention, just be sure to label it with ``[WIP]`` for work-in-progress.
